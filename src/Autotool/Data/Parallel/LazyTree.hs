-- |Generates an infinite list of trees from the given operator set
-- 
-- Does so by running x tree factory in parallel, where each factory differs
-- in the order of operator w/ rank > 0
-- 
-- example `treeP [+,*,-,pow, â€¦]`
-- where `+`,`*` are rank-2 operator, `-`, `pow` are rank-1 operators
-- creates 4 trees with the operator orders
-- - `[-,pow,+,*]`
-- - `[-,pow,*,+]`
-- - `[pow,-,+,*]`
-- - `[pow,-,*,+]`
